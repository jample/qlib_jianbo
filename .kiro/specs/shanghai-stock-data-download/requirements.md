# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automated downloading of Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) stock market data from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01 using qlib's akshare collector. The system will collect comprehensive stock data for all Shanghai-listed stocks using the existing akshare data collection infrastructure, with proper data validation, error handling, and integration with the qlibbase Python environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want to download all Shanghai stock market data from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01, so that I can perform comprehensive backtesting and analysis on Shanghai-listed stocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the download process is initiated THEN the system SHALL collect data for all Shanghai Stock Exchange listed stocks
2. WHEN specifying the date range THEN the system SHALL download data from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01 inclusive
3. WHEN collecting stock data THEN the system SHALL use the akshare collector with qfq (forward adjustment) by default
4. WHEN downloading data THEN the system SHALL save data in qlib-compatible format
5. IF a stock is delisted or suspended THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue with other stocks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the download process to use the qlibbase Python environment, so that I can ensure consistent dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing the download process THEN the system SHALL use the qlibbase conda/virtual environment
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify required packages are installed in qlibbase
3. IF required packages are missing THEN the system SHALL install them only in the qlibbase environment
4. WHEN running the collector THEN the system SHALL activate qlibbase environment before execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to filter and collect only Shanghai Stock Exchange stocks, so that I can focus specifically on Shanghai market analysis without irrelevant data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving stock lists THEN the system SHALL filter for Shanghai Stock Exchange stocks only (codes starting with 60, 68, 90)
2. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL exclude Shenzhen Stock Exchange stocks (codes starting with 00, 30)
3. WHEN processing stock symbols THEN the system SHALL validate Shanghai stock code format
4. IF invalid stock codes are encountered THEN the system SHALL log warnings and skip invalid codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor the download process and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the download process starts THEN the system SHALL log the start time, date range, and number of stocks to process
2. WHEN errors occur during data collection THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages with stock symbol and timestamp
3. WHEN the download process completes THEN the system SHALL log summary statistics including success/failure counts
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. IF rate limiting is encountered THEN the system SHALL respect API limits with appropriate delays

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want the downloaded data to include all essential OHLCV fields and metadata, so that I can perform comprehensive technical and fundamental analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting stock data THEN the system SHALL include date, open, high, low, close, volume, and amount fields
2. WHEN saving data THEN the system SHALL include stock symbol and exchange information
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL handle corporate actions through forward adjustment (qfq)
4. WHEN data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL flag missing data points in logs
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log validation errors and continue processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the download process to be resumable and efficient, so that I can handle large datasets without starting over if interruptions occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the download process is interrupted THEN the system SHALL be able to resume from the last successfully processed stock
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use batch processing to manage memory efficiently
3. WHEN downloading data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting to avoid API blocking
4. WHEN data already exists THEN the system SHALL provide options to skip or update existing data
5. IF disk space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL check available space and warn before starting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the output data to be properly formatted and organized, so that I can easily integrate it with qlib workflows and analysis pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving data THEN the system SHALL organize files by stock symbol in appropriate directory structure
2. WHEN writing data files THEN the system SHALL use CSV format with UTF-8 encoding
3. WHEN creating output directories THEN the system SHALL follow qlib data directory conventions
4. WHEN data collection completes THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report with collection statistics
5. IF data format conversion is needed THEN the system SHALL provide qlib-compatible data format
